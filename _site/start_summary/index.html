<h1>Summary of the start</h1>
<hr>
<p>The characters arrive to Palebank Village, where they meet Elro, the leader of the village. He tells them that there is a strange disease spreading, which has already killed one of the villagers: Urgon Wenth. Apparently, the disease makes you ice cold and stiff. When you eventually die, your body will have turned to stone.</p>
<p>The players get to know that there is one other villager who has gotten the disease, and she lives in the outskirts of the village. Her name is Tulgi Lutan, and the players decide to give her a visit. There, they get to know a little about the backstory:</p>
<p>She and her sister Hulil came to Palebank Village a few years back from Shadycreek Run. They both work for the Uttolot family. They had sent them and a few others to the village to keep an eye on treasures coming back from Eiselcross, so that they could steal them. When Urgon Wenth returned to Palebank Village with treasures from Eiselcross, Tulgi saw her chance. So she waited for Urgon to sell his finds to Pelc's Curiosities and then she stole everything.</p>
<p>She gave most of the relics to Hulil, but kept one for herself: an ornate dagger. She was the one who searched Urgon's cabin, convinced that the dead dwarf must have had magic or other secrets stored away there.</p>
<p>The players do the same: they search through the cabin with permission with the elven guard standing outside. There, they find a receipt which indicates that Urgon sold several Aeorian items found in Eiselcross to Pelc's Curiousities for 1000 GP. The items are listed as a dagger,a  scroll case, a jade statuette, a quiver of 20 arrows, a silver ring set with a jasper, and two blue glass vials.</p>
<p>The players also go to Pelc's Curiosities, which is just a mess at the moment. It is completely raided. They don't really find anything of interest in there at first, but they are ambushed by a gang of bandits. After a pretty hectic fight, containing a lot of ball kicking, they manage to defeat them all. They spare one of the bandits, whom they question and later acquire to their team. They name this guy Freaky Carl.</p>
<p>Freaky Carl tells them about Croaker Cave, a cave filled with giant ice frogs. The players battle with some of these once they are there. This is also where the local bandits live. They make their way through the cave, and eventually meet Hulil, who tells them she believes she has a disease called frigid woe. She doesn't know much about it, but she has heard that explorers in Eiselcross sometimes succumb to it. She also suspects that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials Tulgi stole from Pelc's Curiousities. The vial was cracked, revealing its lovely colour was the result of a dark blue dust clinging to the interior. She is desparate to reach Shadycreek Run before she gets any worse so that she can trade the stolen goods for cure. Since she needed money, she sold the broken vial to a human named Liel.</p>
<p>The party meets this human during a dinner at the local inn. He sits with his family, and they tell them that the entire family must have the disease, since they all have touched the vial.</p>
