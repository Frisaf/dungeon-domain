                <hr>
            
            <p>The party has bought everything they need for the travel to Eiselcross, but before they rest for the night, they visit a food shop where Fenris decides to buy two loafs of bread for Freaky Carl.</p>
<p>The party goes to Jolly Dwarf inn to rest for the night. Arl tells them that Elro has already paid for their rooms, so all they need to do is to go down to the rooms and sleep. Quill takes a seat in front of the campfire, a little annoyed because of the rooms being in the basement. Kalilia lends him her jacket to warm himself.</p>
<p>The next day, the party wakes up to a very stressed Kalilia. She wakes up and suddenly realise that it is very late, and she is afraid that the ship will leave without them. She rushes to wake everyone up, and basically drags Fenris and Freaky Carl out of the bed. She even splashes water on them to wake them up. Fenris and Freaky Carl are very confused as to what exactly Kalilia is up to. She quickly explains that it is late and that they will probably miss the ship's departure if they don't hurry.</p>
<p>They all quickly hurry down to the harbour, Kalilia running before them to make sure the ship doesn't leave without them, which it fortunately hasn't.</p>
<p><em>&quot;We won't leave without you!&quot;</em>, one of the crew members says and chuckles.</p>
<p>As the rest of the party make their way down to the harbour of Palebank Village, they can feel the morning sun's warmth on their skin, but also the chilly winds of the Biting North. When they come closer to the harbour, they spot a large ship docked. It seems like it is ready to sail, based on the crew's position on the deck.</p>
<p>As the characters board the ship, they see a familiar figure standing on the deck: Elro. He approaches them and tells them:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Good morning! This ship will take you to Syrinlya, an Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, the largest island on Eiselcross. Once you are there, talk to Orvo Mustave, and when you have found the cure, use what you need for yourselves and give the rest to 'the Buyer' in Syrinlya. She will teleport the cure to me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The party confirms that they have taken part of the information, and Elro leaves them with a good luck. As soon as he does, the ship begins to sail away and as you stand at the stern you can see Palebank becoming smaller and smaller until it eventually disappears in the horizon. You feel the cool breeze of the air of the sea, its unique smell filling your noses. The deck is big and crossbow turrets line the railings. From what you can see, the crew consists of five people, all of them busy with their own tasks.</p>
<p>Kalilia and Quill decide that they should speak to the captain, however Kalilia can't really spot anyone who looks like a captain. There is a person standing at the helm though. They walk up to the person, and she introduces herself as Gabrika Perphine. She tells them that they will be sailing to Eiselcross, and that the journey will take approximately nine days. If they are in need of assistance, she encourages them to speak to any of the crewmembers, or if they need dirty work to be done they should have their slave Curse do it.</p>
<p>Kalilia and Quill are not very happy with the fact that the crew seems to engage in slavery, so they decide to talk to another crewmember, Valshor, about it. He doesn't reveal a lot, but from what they can tell he is visibly nervous with the subject. They decide to talk with Curse himself instead in order to convince him to accept and embrace freedom. Curse refuses to speak in any other language than Orcish, so Quill has to cast Comprehend languages for Kalilia to understand what Curse is saying. She learns that Curse has been a slave on this ship for the past seven years, and that he is from the Dwendalian Empire. She tries to convince him that freedom is good, and that they should kill the crew to set him free. He does not want to see all of the crewmates die however, even though he hates most of them. He only wants to see Gabrika dead. Kalilia realises that slavery is actually illegal in Palebank Village, which she tries to get Curse to realise, but he does not seem cooperative. Kalilia tries to intimidate Curse to accept freedom, but she only manages to make him angry at her. He pushes her into a boat, but Kalilia continues to intimidate and insult him. Curse rushes towards Kalilia, and raises his hand to strangle her, but before he manages to reach her Gabrika whips him.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Know your place, filthy animal&quot;</em>, she says, <em>&quot;Now continue to clean the deck. I want it to shine once I return here.&quot;</em></p>
<p>She turns to Kalilia and Quill, and excuses his behaviour. She advices them to not speak with Curse anymore. Kalilia plays along and makes a few racist remarks towards Curse. Quill, not knowing that it is all an act, becomes a bit distant and is rather uncomfortable with Kalilia's behaviour. Once Gabrika has returned to her position at the helm, Kalilia explains that:</p>
<p><em>&quot;The best way to make a racist trust you is to be racist&quot;</em></p>
<p>The party makes their way down to the storage rooms and sleeping cabins to make plans and plot against the crew, or more specifically Gabrika.</p>
