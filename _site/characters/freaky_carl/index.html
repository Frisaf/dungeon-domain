<hr>
<p><em>Played by Dungeon Master Ash</em></p>
<p>Carl is Fenris' boyfriend, but life hasn't always been easy for him.</p>
<p>Carl got captured at a young age by the bandits in Croaker Cave and was raised to be a bandit, but he never liked their way of living. One day, he got the chance to escape when he and a few other bandits were robbing Pelc's Curiosities, and he took it. Since that day, he has been travelling with the party of Dungeon Domain.</p>
