In the aftermath of the [basilisk attack](/session_reports/2024/the_basilisk.md), Quill and Kalilia decide to talk to the crewmembers to try to figure out their opinion on their captain, now that she is distracted.

Quill speaks with Valshor and asks about his knowledge about the ship. He tells him that he has sailed his entire life, and that he basically grew up on a ship. He also tells him that he isn't a big fan of Gabrika and her ways. Meanwhile, Kalilia tries to distract Gabrika to ensure that she doesn't notice what Valshor and Quill are talking about.

The party makes a decision to kill Valshor and Gabrika by first tricking Gabrika under deck to kill her. The party tricks her by saying that there are several rats under deck. They lock her into a room, and with nowhere left to go she has to fight them. Quill throws chromatic orb against her but misses and hits the wall, which starts to burn. Kalilia uses this to her advantage, and rams Gabrika into the burning wall. The fire spreads, and Gabrika is now on fire. The smell of burning flesh fills the room as Gabrika screams in agony. Her suffering ends with a single blow from Freaky Carl who puts her out of her misery, and with that also Curse's misery because he is now a free Orch.

When the party loots Gabrika's body they find one [chain shirt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/12-chain-shirt), one [longsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/4-longsword) and 21 silver pieces (SP). Quill dicedied to take the silver.

They try to trick down Faranor with the same trick, but he only wants to send Curse to do the job, because he is the slave who is supposed to do the dirty work. The party agrees on letting Curse take care of the "rats". They take him to the room where Gabrika died and shows him the body while telling him what happened. Curse breaks down in disbelief, overwhelmed by all the feelings there are. Shortly after Curse went under deck, Faranor decides to go after him and see how it is going. When he sees that there are no rats there, he laughs and tells the party good job. Kalilia tells him that there is one rat left, and that is him. Her attempt to intimidate Faranor is not very successful however, but before he gets to say anything, Quill kills Faranor in one blow.

Valshor is still on deck, at the bow. Kalilia approaches him and tries to convince him to help Curse get back home. Valshor turns to them, and it is apparant that he is not sober right now. He tries to avoid her question, but Kalilia continues to push. It is later evident that Valshor is high on weed, but Kalilia takes this from him and makes him promise to stay sober until he has helped Curse. He agrees, because he too wants to get away from the ship that caused him so much suffering.

Left without a captain, the party is now stranded in the middle of the ocean, with only one person who knows how to control the ship. Both Kalilia and Fenris want to learn more about sailing however. Maybe Valshor can learn them how and take them to Eiselcross?
