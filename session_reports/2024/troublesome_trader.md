The party stands right in front of the large pile of bloody corpses in the drunk guy's cousin's basement. Confused on where to go next, Quill finds a paper on the wall with "EISELCROSS" written in large letters on it. Quill manages to recall his geography lessons, where he learned that Eiselcross is the most northern part of Wildemount, and that the only way to get there is by boat. Since it is so far north, it is also very cold, so the party decides that they should find a boat, but also get some warm clothes.

The party barely gets to exit the house when Elro walks towards them. He looks rather stressed, but also weary, as if he has not gotten a lot of sleep last night. Elro tells them that Irven and his family have all catched the sickness. He says that he has made some research about what exactly this sickness might be, and came to the conclusion that it must be Frigid Woe.

*"The only cure for Frigid Woe is located in Eiselcross"*, he says, *"the Aeorians stored this milky liquid in gold vials, and they should be located at the same place where Urgon found the blue vials"*

Elro tells them that he will offer them a ride on the ship Remorhaz, a ship operated by the Glassblades, and that they have one day to prepare. The time is ticking, and unless the party wants Irven and his family to turn to ice statues, they better get going.

Elro leaves them to prepare, and the party heads to a local trader owned by a woman with very monotone voice. Melkor wants to look at magic items, and takes Fenris with him to use his knowledge. Quill on the other hand is looking for items that would help the party to survive the cold environment of Eiselcross, and comes across a shelf with potions. He is very hesitant however, and unsure if they are actually magical. Kalilia notices that Quill has some issues trusting the shopkeeper, and tells him that she's there for him. She reaches out for a hug to comfort him.

After investigating the shelf with potions more thoroughly, Quill manages to find two cold resistance potions. He buys one of them. Kalilia, Quill and Fenris then decide to buy two boxes of winter clothes, after some discussion with the shopkeeper of course. She didn't seem too happy about opening the boxes for them.

Each box contains a pair of gloves, one jacket, a pair of boots and one hat with ear flaps.

Fenris realises that Freaky Carl needs protection from the cold as well and searches for more winter clothes in the same place where they found the boxes, but to no avail. The shopkeeper tells him that there are more clothes among the magical items however, so that is where he continues to search. Luckily, he manages to find a padded Cloak of Protection that will mange to shield Freaky Carl from the cold.
