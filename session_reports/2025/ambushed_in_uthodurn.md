Everyone wake up from their long rest and prepare for a new day. They're slightly sore from [yesterday's fight](/session_reports/2025/the_banshee). Alsol, who polishes her axe, doesn't have any psychological trauma from yesterday, unlike the other party members who still remember the fear instilled by Myra's Horrifying Visage.

Sylvar knocks on the door, and Alsol opens. He wants to remind them that they can collect their reward at the Glassblade's Kaserne, and that he can guide them there. They agree to that. Once there, they are met by some rather boring looking buildings. There are Glassblade soldiers guarding the doors to a few of them, and some soldiers are talking with regular people at the entrance to the city. There is a sign at one of the larger buildings which says "Office". They knock on the door, and after not too long, Lyrei Anafaren opens the door and welcomes them. She motions them to go inside so that they can talk about the Banshee. Lydia tells her everything, and Lyrei gives them their reward: 210 GP. They decide to split the coin evenly between themselves.

Lydia suggests to the rest of the party that they should go shopping with their newly acquired coin. She remembers that Sylvar told them about a magic shop in the Deliberation Disc, which she now wants to visit. The rest of the party follows.

The shop is called *Cloak and Candle* and is run by a human named Here. Lydia asks Here if he has any magic books, because she wants to learn magic. He offers her three books, which cost 100 GP each. Lydia wants all three of them, so she tries to convince Here that 100*3=150. Here, who must have failed maths, is completely oblivious to the fact that he has just been fooled, and accepts Lydia's 150 GP as payment.

Since the books are pretty heavy, Lydia needs to ask Kalilia for help to carry them, since carrying all three of them herself would make her encumbered. And with that, they exit the magic shop. Once outside, they notice that they are observed by a few individuals. Kalilia and Lydia recognise their clothing; they are dressed like Freaky Carl. They make the decision to try to run away from the scene, but everyone except Alsol fails their DEX-saves and they get tripped by one of the people dressed like Freaky Carl (referred to as bandits from now on). A fight starts!

The bandits are pretty easy to defeat, and no one doesn't sustain any severe injuries. Once they are all dead, Lydia hears muffled moans from one of the corpses. She suspects zombies, and she is very much correct.

Kalilia uses [Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Channel%20Divinity%20-%20Turn%20the%20Unholy#content) to turn all but one zombies. Because of this, three of the zombies try to run as far away as they can from Kalilia and the other party members need to run after them.

Soon enough, the zombies are also defeated, and they can loot the bodies. Lydia finds one condom on one of the zombies, Kalilia finds a strange bottle and Alsol finds 1 GP. They decide to carry one of the zombies' body to the Glassblade Kaserne in order to hopefully get another reward.

They meet Lyrei again and explains what happens, but Lyrei has received other reports from witnesses who report that the party were the ones who attacked the bandits. Because of this, they are arrested and put into prison cells. All their belongings get confiscated by the Glassblades, but Lydia manages to hide a dagger in one of her boots.
