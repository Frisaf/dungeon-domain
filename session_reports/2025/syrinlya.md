Morgo Delwur introduces herself and Syrinlya to the party. She gestures to the group of dwarves and elves huddled and chatting around campfires.

*"They're planning expeditions to find Aeor's lost treasures"*, she says, *"that's what this whole place is about. If you ain't exploring, you ain't banking gold."*

They stop at a large fur-lined yurt. Morgo tells them that they can stay there, since the explorer - named Bertron - who had lived there previously ended up being killed by a saber-toothed tiger. Before the party enters the yurt, they notice an elf approaching them. She introduces herself as Lydia, and tells them that her friend Hennry had been afflicted with a mysterious sickness, a sickness that was very similar to the ones our heroes are currently seeking the cure for. Since they all have a common goal, they decide to continue their travels together.

The party enters the yurt, and as they do so they feel the sound of the wind and the biting cold die down. A cold fire put marks the center of the hide-covered floor and an open crate containing packaged rations and a few other items stands next to the door. When they search through the contents of the crate, they find 50 days of rations, a 50-foot silk rope, a blanket, a grappling hook and a book titled *Adventure Sexy: Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds* by Scanlan Shorthalt. Fenris and Kalilia fight over the book, but in the end Fenris got it. While they do so, Lydia manages to sneakily snatch the grappling hook. Fenris takes the rope and Lydia takes the blanket. They split up the rations.

After splitting up the items in the crate, they decide to visit the buyer, whom they are a tad suspiscious about. They end up selling the Aeorian dagger that they got back in Palebank Village to the Buyer for 110 GP, after haggling for the price. The Buyer tells the party about the magic chest, which they can transport items to secret locations in Uthodurn and Palebank Village with.

After their visit to the Buyer, the party visits Orvo Mustave, who lives in a relatively small tent. He tells them that he and Urgon found the blue vials in Salsvault, an Aeorian ruin that was partially submerged in water in a region north of Foren where the glacial ice is thin. He thinks that the building is reinforced with magic since it is so well preserved. This place, Salsvault is located two hundred miles northwest of Syrinlya, and ice mephits are drawn to the magic of something there. It was after following one of these creatures that Urgon and Orvo found Salsvault. They explored this place and found three chambers of what seems to have been an abandoned Aeorian lab, but they were later chased away by animated suits of armour. They got the vials though, but they did not know what they contained. Orvo sold his share of the treasure to the Buyer but Urgon decided to keep his until he returned to Palebank Village.

After speaking to Orvo, the party decides to make some final preparations. Lyda buys material to craft four fire arrows, Kalilia writes a letter to her wife about their adventures and they soon head out.

On their first day, they encounter a wildfolk who has run out of arrows. They trade arrows for information about the landscape.

On their second day, they encounter a young remorhaz, which immediately attacks them. After being on the brim of death, Kalilia finally manages to slay it.
