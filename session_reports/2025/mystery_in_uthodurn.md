The party is in Uthodurn, and they are on their way to the Grandcast Citadel because they heard of elves that had started to mysteriously disappear in the city. Once there, they have to wait a little, because the city's rulers are currently busy with an audience with another visitor. They take their time to explore the waiting hall a little. The walls are made out of marble, and the Citadel itself, an impressive palace where the dual monarchs of Uthodurn rule their people, is carved into the central stalactite pillars to resemble an inverse tower. It looks a little like a frozen, underground tornado.

After not too long, a woman exits the audience hall. She greets the party and introduces herself as Lyrei Anafaren: leader of the local Glassblades. The party introduces themselves as well, and she asks them what brings them to the Grandcast Citadel. They tell her they are trying to get more information about the elves that have started to disappear lately.

*"Oh, then I would be the right person to speak with!"* she says. *"Ancient elves, old enough to remember the destruction of Molaesmyr, are withering and dying in the streets at night. Witnesses all report hearing the same thing before finding the bodies: a horrible wail."*

The party works out, together with Lyrei, that they should spend time with an elder elf named Sylvar Ilvaris in order to protect him, and in the worst case scenario get some more clues about the culprit if he were to die. The party asks her a few questions about the case and where to find Sylvar, and she points them to the inn called *The Broken Stool* located in the Volition Disc where they may be able to gather more information.

They listen in on a few conversations. Most people talk about the recent news, or are too drunk to be understood. The party decides to talk with the latter, and they send Lydia to do the job. In order to blend in, she rolls a successive performance check. The group cheers for her, as she offers everyone a round of drinks.

One of the dwarfs at the table is extremely drunk and is ranting about his boss, and one of the elves seem to be very upset that his ex girlfriend left him, which was why he came to the inn. He is crying, and almost screaming in agony about the breakup. The party decides that it may be best to escort him home. He tells them he lives down the street with his uncle, and that his name is Kringor.

Toghether, they help carry him home to his uncle, which they later learn is named Sylvar. Once home, he is a bit upset and worried about Kringor.

*"Have you been drinking again?!"* he says with a raised voice.

Kringor is way too drunk to answer. He gets escorted to the bathroom where he pukes.

Sylvar tells the party he is grateful for bringing home Kringor, and that he is a mage. Lydia is suddenly very interested, and Sylvar promises to take her to a magic shop in the Deliberation Disc later. They later go on to talk about the murders, and while Sylvar isn't too worried about being the next victim, he is aware of the risks of being alone, so he accepts their offer of protecting him.

Sylvar offers them a room where they can stay for the night. It's been a long day, so the party decides to take a long rest, during which they exchange tales of their past.

The next day, Sylvar gives them a quick tour of the city:
- Volition Disc:
    - They start here
    - This is the widest and oldest part of the city, and also where most of the population lives.
    - The houses are a mishmash of angular stone abodes and lofty elven homesteads.
    - The district is bisected by a central road called the Auger Trail, which they are walking through.
        - It has multiple purposes, such as acting as a thoroughfare as well as a forum lined with tables, carts and benches.
    - This is also where the Topper Mines are located, which is where they mine for iron.
    - The Glassblades have their headquarters here.
- Deliberation Disc - or the Liber Disc:
    - The Auger Trail eventually leads to here.
    - This part of the city is filled from top to bottom with homes, emporiums, forges and shops.
    - Many Uthodurnians come here to shop, including Sylvar.
    - This is in general just a district filled with all sorts of entertainment or other businessess.
- The Grand Disc:
    - Apart from the Grandcast Citadel, this part of the city also houses the Luddenbrock Mines, which pulls more precious metals from the deeper parts of the mountain.

The party walks closer to the Grandcast Citadel, when suddenly they here a horrible wail. A terrifying creature attacks from above, and all the party members immediately realise that this is a [Banshee](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17089-banshee). She seems to be targetting Sylvar, only attacking others if they stand in her way.

Just when everybody thinks they are about to win the fight, the Banshee escapes. As she does, she releases a mournful wail. Both Kalilia and Lydia succeed their constitution saving throws, but Alsol doesn't and drops to 0 HP. Kalilia manages to revive her with Lay on Hands. Alsol tries to give Kalilia money for the favour, to which she refuses. They have a small argument about it, which ends up in Kalilia having to accept the money from Alsol.

With their help, Sylvar managed to survive the attack, and he is incredibly grateful and thanks them deeply.

### DM Notes
I may or may not have forgotten a few details, which were improvised during the session. For example, I don't remember if Kringor puked in the kitchen, the living room or the bathroom. Just wanted to provide a disclaimer if something doesn't feel right about some parts of the session report.
