The party, who have just finished their quest in finding the cure for Frigid Woe, finds themselves back in Syrinlya. There has come a fresh face to the encampment, and not even the inhabitants of Syrinlya seem to know who it is. Morgo approaches the tall human with braided hair and asks who she is. She introduces herself as Alsol, a former soldier with a relatively bad memory seeking adventures. Everyone else introduces themselve, but both Lydia and Kalilia are suspicious of Alsol.

Alsol decides to join the party, and Lydia and Kalilia explain to her what's going on.

The letter that the party got from Freaky Carl back in [Salsvault](/session_reports/2025/salsvault.md) mentions The Myriad, which is a name very familiar to Lydia. They are illegal traders who trade with slaves, illicit substances, magical beasts, hire muscle, and the like. Their goal is to infiltrate the Clovis Concord, ultimatedly destroying it and taking control of Shadycreek Run. Therefore, they decide to go to Port Damali, which is Lydia's home town. They go a bit back and forth on how exactly they are going to get there.

Eventually, they decide on asking The Buyer for help. Kalilia jokes about offering souls to them, to which they (jokingly) agrees to. They then (seriously) suggest using the magic stone chest to teleport them back to the mainland. They can get teleported to either Palebank Village or Uthodurn. Since Uthodurn is more south, they choose that as their destination.

Alsol risks it and gets into the magic chest. She gets a little dizzy, but otherwise she seems fine. The chest's lid opens, and she sees a bald man with a mustache appearing in front of her. The bald man acts very shocked, but he quickly regains his cool and puts on a blindfold on Alsol and hogties her.

He interrogates her about why she is here, and she tells him about the rest of the party, and how they just wanted to get back to the mainland. He grunts and let her go back into the chest, eventually. When she returns safely, she tells the rest of the party about what happened. They determine it's safe enough to travel through the stone chest, so one by one they get teleported.

Once there, they get interrogated about their ideals, but since they mention The Buyer, they are determined non-enemeies and get to go out of the situation unharmed, but hogtied and blindfolded. They are lead out of the building by the bald dwarf and escorted out to the streets of Uthodurn. Once there, they enter a tavern filled with dwarven miners.

The barkeep tells them about the murders and the supposed spies from Shadycreek Run. The party decides to help with the murders, so they make their way to the Grandcast Citadel.
