Fenris, who is just having a nice meal, notices the antidote chest in the water and gathers the rest of the party. Lydia checks the water for traps, since she wants to get it. She gets there and lockpicks the chest. Inside of it there is:
- 1 Ersatz Eye
- 20 doses of frigid woe antidote
They decide ot only give the Buyer 1 dose and give the rest out themselves.

Suddenly, they hear footsteps and before they know it the antidotes are snatched from them and they hear someone run off through the corridors. They start to chase the mysterious thief by following the footprints on the dusty floor. They come to a room, which turns out to be a disease storage with chests filled with Frigid Woe, according to Ferol Sal. The next room is in immaculate condition, and it seems to have been cleaned up after the destruction seen elsewhere. A crisply made bed stands at the center of the west wall, with small tables off to either side. The room also contains a stone desk set with a chair, and a chest built into the floor. Fenris opens the chest, and a swarm of undead snakes attack. It is a pretty short battle, and Ferol finally kills the last snake. The party finds out that this room had belonged to Ferol, and are doubting whether or not they should steal the money they find in the chest. However, when Ferol isn't looking, Kalilia sneakily takes 201 gold pieces from the chest.

The next room is only rubble, but upon removing the rubble a rug of smothering breaks free and attacks the party, but they manage to kill this one easily as well.

Finally, they find Freaky Carl in the very last room. After exchanging a few words, Carl casts a powerful spell that kills Ferol Sal in one single blow. Lydia finds out about Agent R7, which she suspects to be her friend Rhyannon. This makes her very surprised and shocked, and Fenris is very sad that Freaky Carl turned out to betray them all, so due to heartbreak Fenris now has disadvantage on all rolls.

Upon casting detect magic, Lydia finds out that Carl has some type of scroll hidden on him, but when she and Kalilia try to search his body he teleports away. He left all the stolen antidote behind though, and among them is a note. Lydia reads it:

*To the Myriad, Agent R7. From Agent C3.*

They decide to go back, and with Ferol Sal out of the game, they can now take the rest of his tressure without worry (1006 SP and 45 EP). They then return to Syrinlya, and the travel back is rather uneventful. They give 10 doses of the antidote to the Buyer and keep the rest.
