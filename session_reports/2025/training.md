Eventually, after a few days, the party reaches Syrinlya. They hear Valshor shout:
*"Land ahead!"*
Remorhaz slowly enteres the small harbour and as the ship comes to a full stop Curse lowers down the gangway.

The temperature has steadily dropped since the party left Palebank Village, yet it seems to grow colder still as they step off the ramp of the Remorhaz onto Foren. Through windy snow, they can see fur-lined tents and yurts arranged in a large camp. Campfires are whipped by the wind, with dwarves and elves huddled close to the flames.

*"Don't worry! It'll cool down here eventually!"* a joking voice bellows over the snow.

A female dwarf with a shaggy mane of unkempt hair bows to the party.

*"Morgo Delwur at your service. Welcome to Eiselcross!"*
