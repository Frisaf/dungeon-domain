The Banshee escaped, but luckily, the party saw where it went: south. So they decide to go after it. They end up in the Main Plaza in the Grand Disc, where they decide to ask around if anyone has seen it. Julia asks a middle aged dwarf, but he just wants to get home at this time of the day.

Suddenly, they hear a someone scream in an alley, but no one is able to hear where it came from. They decide to search each alley around the Main Plaza instead, and after some searching, they manage to find the Banshee, along with a dead elven woman. Since the Banshee hasn't seen them yet, Julia manages to sneak up on the Banshee and attack. And so the fight begins...

On the Banshee's turn, she uses Horrifying Visage, which frightens everybody but Sylvar and Alsol. They must have seen far worse things than the fase of a Banshee, even though it's certainly terrifying!

After some *almost* near death experiences, Alsol finally manages to weaken the Banshee so much she is unable to attack. Lydia wants to attempt to talk to her. She asks why she wants to kill all of these elves. The Banshee tells them the following:
- Her name is Myra Quirn.
- She was an elf before, but turned into a banshee when she was left behind as her people fled Molaesmyr.
- She then turned into a vengeful spirit by the ruins' dark magic.
- After many years of searching, she found that her kin still lived and thrived in Uthodurn.
- She plans to avenge every single one of those who left her behind.

Kalilia recognises the name Molaesmyr, since that is the name of the forest in which the Blooming Grove is in. She tells Myra about this, and she is interested in hearing more about it, like how the forest is doing today. So Kalilia tells her about the curse, and the warped trees. In turn, Myra tells them about the forest's backstory; that they once lived and thrived there until the curse came and killed a lot of them. Kalilia realises that the curse might have something to do with her wife's *ailment*.

Alsol tries to persuade Myra that revenge isn't the way to go. Unfortunately, she doesn't really succeed. Myra is still not entirely convinced. Since she doesn't want to cooperate, Kalilia finishes her off.

To thank them for their help, Sylvar gives each party member two [Potions of Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4708-potions-of-healing). He also invites them back to his house to rest after the fight. Once there, all three party members take a long rest, and they plan to collect their reward at the Glassblades the next day.
