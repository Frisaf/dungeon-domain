Lydia, who is standing guard, applies poison to her weapon, and once everybody is well rested they continue their explorations. Kalilia decides to go first into the next room, where three zombies attack the party. The fight is successful, and Lydia and Fenris manages to place the final blow. The next room is filled with old weapons and armour, all useless. A few of these weapons are not what they seem to be. They are flying swords and they attack the party. They are however soon defeated. Fenris kills one sword, Nim first kills two of them, Lydia another one and Nim kills the last remaining one.

The party contemplates if they want to go into a room with a large red X painted across the stone door. They hear violent banging and the sound of heavy objects being tossed around the chamber. They decide not to, and instead they go into a room where they meet a certainly odd figure. His name is Ferol Sal, and he has gone mad. Nim speaks to him. After a bit of conversing back and forth, Nim manages to gain his trust and he tells them where the antidote to Frigid Woe is.

In the room where the antidote is supposed to be, they are attacked by crabs. Lydia however, sneaks away and goes back to Ferol. She is angry about all the damage Ferol has caused when making this disease and she wants to kill him. Ferol casts Life Drain on Lydia, whose HP is now 4. Nim rushes back, and makes Lydia agree to not kill Ferol if he doesn't make more diseases and they help him kill the gods. Lydia even gives a healing potion to Ferol, and Kalilia gives him 2 basilisk eyes.
