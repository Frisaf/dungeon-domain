It is the party's third day of searching for Salsvault, and on this day they find a corpse laying in the snow as they wander through the snow-filled landscape. As they approach it, they notice that it probably has been dead for quite soem time judging from the almost blue skin that this elf has. Kalilia loots the body and find an [Amulet of the Drunkard](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:amulet-of-the-drunkard). They remember that this is the amulet that the drunk guy in the tavern back in Palebank Village asked them to find.

Another day dawns and the party wakes up in the cold landscape feeling refreshed, ready to travel yet another day. When they look at each other, they realise that someone is missing. Freaky Carl is missing. During the night, it has snowed, so all potential traces have been covered.

They continue to travel, and with Lydia as newly assigned scout they manage to find Salsvault, and outside of it waits two ice mephits. Kalilia tries to interact with them, upon which they attack her and the rest of the party. Lydia kills one of them, Glacies, in one blow and the other one is killed shortly after.

The door to Salsvault is locked, and when Kalilia tries to open the door, she rolls a nat 1 and makes a somersault towards the door instead of ramming it as intended. They still manage to open the door with just a little bit of trouble, so they can now enter Salsvault. They converse in regular conversation volume, but they are heard by two animated armours. Lydia manages to kill one of them with little to no trouble, but everyone else misses their attacks - even the remaining animated armour. During this fight, everyone rolls a nat 1, the DM included. After several rounds though, Fenris manages to kill the last animated armour. Kalilia takes the armour pieces and equips them.

In the next room, they find a blacksmith under some rubble, but it shows no gratitude and attacks the party instead. Lydia kills the blacksmith and takes his tools. After a lot of fighting, the party members are now tired and decide to take a long rest. Lydia decides to stand guard and only take a short rest instead.
