The party finds themselves in jail, so they try to communicate with each other between the cells. The guard does not like these attempts, and threatens to punish them with the whip. So instead of using verbal communication, Kalilia tries to use some sort of body language to communicate with Alsol, but rolls a nat 1 and fails.

Lydia calls the guard over and asks for a glass of water. The guard asks another guard to and fetch a glass of water for her. Kalilia on the other hand, decides to annoy the guard. The whip punishment is not very far away...

Lydia decides to call the guard over once again, and this time, she manages to convince the guard to ask her boss if she can give Lydia one of her books. During the time the guard is gone, the party makes up a plan to potentially run away if they lose the trial and their sentence is bad.

After being gone for a while, she comes back and she unfortunately could not give her one of her books. She assures Lydia that they all will get their belongings back if they win the trial though.

To kill some time, Kalilia plays an unnamed fantasy card game with the guard. She bets 10 GP with the guard, but loses both rounds, and with that also her money.

The next day, they are woken up by a few guards who put shacles on the ankles and their wrists. The shackles are connected, so they are all tied to the same chain. The guards guide them to a wagon, which is being pulled by a horse. The wagon is made out of wood, has got iron bars as walls, and a wooden roof. When they all have been brought onto the wagon, the travel to the Grandcast Citadel starts. Multiple guards guard the front, the sides as well as the back of the caravan. The ride is rather uneventful, and the caravan reaches its destination in approximately one hour.

The party gets unloaded from the wagon and guided into the Grandcast Citadel. Inside, they get brought to the throne room, in which multiple guards are standing. There are two royal looking individuals standing at the end of the throne room; one elf and one dwarf. It is King Imathan Talviel and Queen Simone Fruunast.

The dual monarchs present the reason for the trial, and explain that their decision is public execution. However, the inmates are all allowed a defense speech each. Unfortunately, all three fails to convince the monarchs they are innocent. When they have all given their speeches, the witnessess give their side of the story. There are two witnessess: Sylvar Ilvaris and a random citizen. When they are done, the monarchs go out from the throne room to discuss. When they are done, they give their final verdict: public execution.

In the meantime, Kalilia senses undead in the area. She tries to see where this undead creature could be, and who it might be. Alsol notices Lyrei seems a little nervous. She tells the guards and they start to seach everyone in the area surrounding Lyrei. Suddenly, Lyrei's skin changes, and she reveals herself to be a skinstealer. It kills two surrounding guards before the real battle begins. The players manage to free themselves from their shackles.

After a lot of back and forth, Alsol manages to kill the skinstealer. As thanks, the Queen lowers their punishment. Instead of being publicly executed, they will get their honorary citizenship revoked, and they will be banished from the city.
